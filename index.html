      <h1>China 1900s-2000s: A History of Merciless Conflicts and Perils</h1>
      <p> In 1911, it was a year of chaos and filled with rebellious uprisings by the Chinese people, with their intention of bringing an extinction to the Manchu-led dynasty which existed for 276 years.
        This revolution, called as the Xinhai Revolution, was the fundamental step towards the end of the Chinese monarchy, which was led by corrupt politicians and exhausted Empress Dowager Cixi. 
        As a result of the revolution, the Beiyang Army, led by Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat Sen, alongside his revolutoionaries overthrew the last Emperor of China, Puyi who was still a child during that time. 
        After the successful revolution, a provisional government was established by Sun Yat Sen and his revolutionaries, who were member of the Kuomintang. But the control of the country was actually controlled by the Beiyang Army/Beiyang Government under Yuan Shikai. 
        Furthermore, there was an agreement in which Sun Yat Sen agreed to receive help from Yuan Shikai and his modern army, but in exchange for power in the country. 
        In 1915, Yuan Shikai suddenly turned the country into a monarchy and proclaimed himself as the Emperor of China under the Empire of China. Unfortunately, it did not took a long time for the attempt of a monarchy to fail and it became a republic again. 
        BUT, with more chaos. With Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, there was a power vacuum for military leaders to seize territories themselves. This was called the Warlord Era. Seeing this, the second leader of the Kuomintang party, Chiang Kai Shek appointed by Sun Yat Sen led assaults
        and this is called the Northern Expedition, where the army fought against warlords and the emerging communists (CCP).
